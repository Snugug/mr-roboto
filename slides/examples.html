  <ul>
    <li>Three examples</li>
    <li>First, a simple application showing what just one cognitive API can do</li>
    <li>Next, a more complex one, showing what can be accomplished by combining multiple cognitive APIs in to one application</li>
    <li>Finally, what's possible today, not quite by API yet, but what the future holds</li>
    <li>All of these examples are built on Watson, with the APIs all having free usage periods and the final application being free to use</li>
