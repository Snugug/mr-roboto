<h2>What is Cognitive Computing?</h2>

<p><span class="fragment">A new field of computing</span><span class="fragment">, for working on Human-complex problems</span><span class="fragment">, using machine learning and artificial intelligence</span><span class="fragment">, with Human-natural input and output.</span></p>

    <ol>
      <li>The types of problems that can be solved using CC are unlike any problems that have come before and the tech is just now coming out of research</li>
      <li>Problems that previously couldn't be worked on by computers due to the input's data or the type of non-linear understanding needed in order to reason about about the domain</li>
      <li>AI, machine, and deep learning provide the groundwork to be able to train computers to reason about these Human-complex domains</li>
      <li>Beyond keyword text search. Speech, full-sentence and long-form unstructured text, images, audio, video, all become potential inputs and outputs allowing us to interact more like we would with another human</li>
